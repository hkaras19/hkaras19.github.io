                            Group Study allows students in clubs, independent projects, and extra circular activities to connect with others around the world 
                            and discuss their passions. By creating a platform specially designed for students, users are able to connect and learn from 
                            others outside of their school community. The possibilities are endless.

                                Upon signing up for an account, you'll be guided through the process of selecting your school, or community, and which clubs, 
                                organizations, or activities you are currently involved or interested in. These two factors then place you into group chats 
                                where you will be able to contact other users on a school, local, or global level to discuss.

                        revolutionary time of growth. For the first time in history, the chalkboard is being replaced by cutting edge technology, 
                        specifically designed for student learning. Although the classroom has grown significantly, the expansion has just begun. 
                        While technology is helping students in the classroom, there are few tools to form connections and foster learning outside 
                        of the classroom. Group Study allows students from school, local, and global communities to pursue their passions. Users have 
                        access to virtual tools to provide them with a convenient platform to improve their skills, bringing new contributions to the 
                        community.
